    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Neha Nepal, and I am a fourth year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I was born in Nepal and moved to the United States when I was seven years old. UCSB had been my dream school since my freshman year of high school, but by senior year, it became my third choice. Initially, I applied to most schools with plans to pursue aerospace engineering. However, after visiting UCSB, I realized it was the perfect fit for me and chose it over my other options. Because UCSB doesnâ€™t offer an aerospace engineering program, I enrolled in Mechanical Engineering and have thrived in the program. Meeting peers with interests ranging from bioengineering to mechatronics has broadened my perspective and diversified my interests. While I remain passionate about aerospace engineering, my focus has expanded to heat transfer and fluid mechanics more generally. </p>
