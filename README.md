    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Neha Nepal, and I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I was born in Nepal and moved to the United States when I was seven years old. UCSB had been my dream school since my freshman year of high school, but by senior year, it became my third choice. Initially, I applied to most schools with plans to pursue aerospace engineering. However, after visiting UCSB, I realized it was the perfect fit for me and chose it over my other options. Because UCSB doesn’t offer an aerospace engineering program, I enrolled in Mechanical Engineering and have thrived in the program. Meeting peers with interests ranging from bioengineering to mechatronics has broadened my perspective and diversified my interests. While I remain passionate about aerospace engineering, my focus has expanded to include sustainable energy solutions and optimizing systems for energy efficiency within the field.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>I am an incoming undergraduate research assistant at the FES-Lab, starting in Winter Quarter 2025. Our research focuses on evaluating how the efficiency of direct air capture (DAC) devices changes as their size is scaled down. The overarching goal is to determine if it’s possible to reduce the size of these machines while maintaining or improving efficiency, thereby decreasing production and operational costs.


My specific role in the lab involves designing and building an experimental setup that uses an Arduino microcontroller to operate several peristaltic pumps. These pumps will precisely inject and withdraw water infused with dyes, simulating the dynamics of a chemical reaction. By controlling the flow rates and patterns, this system aims to mimic the processes occurring in DAC machines, such as carbon absorption and processing.


This experimental setup will enable us to study the fundamental interactions and efficiencies of scaled-down DAC processes in a controlled, small-scale environment. The findings from this work could contribute to optimizing DAC technology, making it more accessible and cost-effective for large-scale carbon capture efforts.</p>

      The Billiard Simulation Project simulates the motion and collision dynamics of two balls (one blue and one red) in a confined space using MATLAB. The simulation takes into account various forces, including gravity, drag, and friction, to model the motion of the balls. Using principles of physics, the code calculates the velocities, positions, and collision responses of the balls when they hit walls or each other, accounting for energy loss due to damping and friction. The project also includes collision handling with walls and between the balls, using velocity predictions and adjusting them based on the impacts.

      <h3>Rep Counter</h3>
      For my design class, I maintained a comprehensive record of all my projects, including drawings, sketches, invention ideas, circuitry, SolidWorks designs, and the final project. The final project, which won the "Most Technical Project" award in the class, is showcased on pages 31-38 of the slideshow, accompanied by a video.

      In this project, I designed and built a fully operational air motor, utilizing a range of machining tools and techniques. I operated band saws for cutting raw stock and used Haas vertical mills to precisely cut and drill key motor components. Additionally, I demonstrated machining proficiency by working with lathes to shape, sand, and drill spherical components. After assembly, I achieved an air motor speed of 2800 RPM, surpassing the expected performance by 400 RPM. I conducted thorough performance tests to ensure the motor met all design specifications and ran efficiently. Throughout the project, I documented the process, including design iterations and troubleshooting, providing a comprehensive record of the build.
